# Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) Using Dask Framework for Dynamic Pricing Trends

## Project Overview

This project focuses on performing an in-depth Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to uncover patterns, relationships, and insights from historical sales and pricing data. By leveraging EDA techniques, we aim to identify key factors such as seasonal trends, price elasticity, and competitor influences on sales performance. The insights derived from this analysis can inform data-driven decision-making and future pricing strategies.

The analysis emphasizes understanding sales sensitivity using the price elasticity formula:

     Elasticity = {% Change in Sales Quantity}/{% Change in Price} 

This approach quantifies how pricing decisions impact sales, revealing trends and patterns critical for businesses to remain competitive.

## Features

- **Comprehensive Data Analysis**: Identify correlations, trends, and patterns in pricing and sales data.
- **Price Elasticity Evaluation**: Analyze how price changes affect demand to understand consumer sensitivity.
- **Competitor Comparison**: Explore the impact of competitor pricing on sales.
- **Seasonal Insights**: Highlight demand fluctuations across different times of the year using Dask Framework to fasten computation results for large datasets.
- **Visualization**: Use interactive and static plots to convey key findings.

## Key Components

- **Data Collection**: Historical sales, pricing, and seasonal data.
- **Data Preprocessing**: Clean and structure data for effective analysis.
- **Exploratory Analysis**: Apply statistical and visualization techniques to extract insights.
- **Key Insights**: Summarize findings to guide strategic decision-making.
